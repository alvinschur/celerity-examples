h2. Introduction

This project provides examples of testing web applications that use javascript and AJAX.  The main tools are "Cucumber":cucumber to describe the required behaviour and "Celerity":celerity for simulating a web browser and executing the javascript.

Specifying the required behaviour consists of 2 parts:
# running the web application using your favourite staging environment
# driving the web application using jRuby, cucumber, celerity, rspec, and friends

h2. Getting started

Celerity requires "jRuby":jruby.  Celerity, cucumber, rspec, and other gems required for specifying the required behaviour are installed in the jRuby environment.

Libraries required for running the application
Install
* "Ramaze":ramaze - Easy web app framework
* "jRuby":jruby
* "Celerity":celerity
* "Cucumber":cucumber
* "Rspec":rspec

Verify the web application is installed correctly by
# ruby start.rb
# browse to "localhost:7000":http://localhost:7000
You should see "Welcome to Ramaze"

Verify jRuby, cucumber, rspec are installed correctly by
# jrake features


You should see

<pre>
Feature: Verify Cucumber, celerity, rspec are installed  # features/verify_cucumber_installation.feature
  In order verify web application behaviour
  the development team should be able to 
  run cucumber and celerity
  Scenario: visit the web application home page  # features/verify_cucumber_installation.feature:6
    When I visit the home page                   # features/step_definitions/first_steps.rb:19
    Then I should see "Welcome to Ramaze!"       # features/step_definitions/first_steps.rb:23
